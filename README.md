This is a Chrome extension that looks at Hotwire's Hot Rates hotel listings and uses information from http://hotwirehotellist.com and matches recommendation percentages and star ratings in order to determine possibilities for the unknown hotels. Initially, the idea was to use TripAdvisor information in order to perform the filtering, but due to the lack of a public API as well as the availability of a website that provides known listings, I decided to use that website instead. I also found that those two pieces of information were generally sufficient in order to narrow the possibilities down to one hotel, and so using TripAdvisor data would be redundant.
